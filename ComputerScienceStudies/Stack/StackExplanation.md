# Stack:

A stack is a **Data Structure** implementing the Last In First Out (LIFO) order.

The bottom of the stack is the **first item added**, and the top contains the **last item added**. When you **pop** you remove the **last item added**.


## Real Life usage:

A stack can be used in many real life usages. Normally in Software Engineering, each CPU thread has a Stack, and when a method is called, method data, such as parameters, are added to the stack, usually, the last method called in the stack, the data of that method is at the top.
