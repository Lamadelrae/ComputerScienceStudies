# Queue:

A queue is a **Data Structure** implementing the First In First Out (FIFO) order.

The start of the queue contains the **first item added**, and the end of the queue contains the **first item added**. When you **dequeue** you remove the first item, and so on, it goes in a **linear** order.

## Real Life usage:

A queue can be used when order matters. An example in software engineering is CPU scheduling, the CPU schedules processes to be executed in a FIFO order.
